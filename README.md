# Machine Learning

This repository contains 5 projects for the course Machine Learning.

Library used: pandas, pandas_ml, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn, tabulate



1. Tree Classification

   Implemented binary and multiway decision trees for classification Trees with numerical and categorical features

   

2. Regression

   Implemented Linear Regression, Least Squares Regression, Univariate Regression, Polynomial Regression and Ridge Regression using gradient descent, normal equations, and maximum likelihood.

   

3. Naive Bayes for Document Classification

   Built Multivariate Bernoulli Model and Multinomial Event Model for document generation and maximized posteriori estimates of model parameters.

   

4. Model Hyper-parameters

   Set model hyper-parameters using a nested cross-validation strategy.

   

5. Clustering

   Implemented k-Means clustering algorithm to cluster datasets and used SSE and NMI to determine clustering quality.
